# Restaurant Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales and operational data from a fast-food restaurant chain. The analysis aims to uncover key insights into customer behavior, popular menu items, and operational efficiency to help drive business decisions.

## Objectives
1. **Sales Analysis**
   - Identify the most and least popular menu items.
   - Calculate Average Order Value (AOV) and its trends.
   - Assess the impact of discounts and promotions on revenue.

2. **Customer Behavior Analysis**
   - Determine peak hours and days of the week for orders.
   - Analyze customer repeat behavior and order patterns.

3. **Operational Analysis**
   - Calculate Food Cost percentage for each item.
   - Evaluate inventory turnover rates.
   - Identify inefficiencies in operations.

4. **Forecasting**
   - Predict revenue based on day of the week and time of day.
   - Simulate the impact of menu and pricing changes on revenue.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three primary datasets:
- **Orders Dataset**: Contains order details such as date, time, menu items, and total price.
- **Menu Dataset**: Includes menu item details such as name, category, price, and cost.
- **Guests Dataset**: Provides customer information such as demographics and referral sources.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- **SQL**: For querying and transforming data.
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For creating dashboards and data visualizations.
